# Backorder_Prediction
When a customer orders a product which is not available in the store or out-of-stock temporarily or due to lack of supply, the customer decides to wait until the desired product is available and there is a guaranteed delivery, then this scenario is called Backorder of the specific product. If the backorders are not handled promptly , there is a high chance of losing a customer to its competitor , along with impact on revenue ,share market price etc. On the other hand, taking actions to satisfy or reduce backorders puts tremendous amounts of pressure on the different stages of supply chain management. Taking steps to satisfy or reduce backorders will lead to increased labor/production/transport/Warehouse costs etc.
Machine Learning can identify patterns related to backorders before the customer orders. With this, the production can adjust to minimize delays for customer service and provide accurate dates to keep the customers informed. This predictive analysis approach gives the company ample time to react and enables them to satisfy the demands of customers and smooth the supply chain process. The case study "Backorder Prediction" deals with predicting the backorders of products by applying Machine Learning techniques to overcome or reduce the cost of backorders. We will identify parts with the highest chances of shortage so that we could present a high opportunity to improve the company's overall performance.
